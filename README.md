# ScanBuy-Android-Application
Android application for ScanBuy Assessment 


3. SCANBOOK MOBILE PROJECT: Mobile Skills Assessment
Write an application that allows me to inventory my books. Choose the latest version of iOS or Android for your target OS.
As a user of this app, it should allow me to scan the barcode code from the book and then type in the information about that book, such as title, author, number of pages, and whether or not I've read it. (For bonus points, it could look up the information for that book via Amazon or some other web service).
I should be shown a list of the books I have added. When I tap on one of the books in the list, I should see the detail view for that book (showing all of the information I entered).
If I scan a book that I had already scanned, it should know that the record already exists, and should show the information for that book.
Expectations:
 Use the native scanner provided by the OS and call this from your app.
 If I close the app and open it again, the items in my inventory should still show.
